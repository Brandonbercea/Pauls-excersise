    "- Using the data types you’ve learned, we’re going to make an excercise chooser. \n",
    "- The excercises consist of 2 categories, 3 subcategories in each, and three levels of difficulty. \n",
    "- The two main categories are strengthening and stretching. \n",
    "- The subcategories are, lying, side, and standing.\n",
    "- The difficulties are L1, L2, and L3. \n",
    "- Using the data types you have learned, write a python script that will take inputs of how many strengthening excercises you want and how many stretches you want.\n",
    "- It should then pick 70% of the excercises from L1 and 30% of the excercises from L2. Randomly."
